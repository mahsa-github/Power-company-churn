# Power-company-churn
## Business understanding 
•	Your client is PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to small and medium sized enterprises.
•	The energy market has had a lot of change in recent years and there are more options than ever for customers to choose from.
•	PowerCo are concerned about their customers leaving for better offers from other energy providers. When a customer leaves to use another service provider, this is called churn.
•	This is becoming a big issue for PowerCo and they have engaged BCG to help diagnose the reason why their customers are churning.
## Hypothesis
1.	What do you think are the key reasons for a customer deciding to stay with or switch energy providers? For example: price, is it clean energy, customer service, location etc.
2.	What data do you think would be useful in order to investigate these key reasons? E.g. customer purchasing trends over past 5 years, location of business etc.
3.	If you were to get this data, how could you analyse or visualize it to test whether these reasons may have an impact on churn?
