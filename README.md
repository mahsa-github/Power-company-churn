# Power-company-churn
## Business understanding 
•	Your client is PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to small and medium sized enterprises.
•	The energy market has had a lot of change in recent years and there are more options than ever for customers to choose from.
•	PowerCo are concerned about their customers leaving for better offers from other energy providers. When a customer leaves to use another service provider, this is called churn.
•	This is becoming a big issue for PowerCo and they have engaged BCG to help diagnose the reason why their customers are churning.
## Hypothesis
1.	What do you think are the key reasons for a customer deciding to stay with or switch energy providers? For example: price, is it clean energy, customer service, location etc.
2.	What data do you think would be useful in order to investigate these key reasons? E.g. customer purchasing trends over past 5 years, location of business etc.
3.	If you were to get this data, how could you analyse or visualize it to test whether these reasons may have an impact on churn?
## 1. Data Requirements:
To investigate the key reasons for customer retention or switching energy providers, we will need the following data from the client:

•  Customer demographics (age, income, location, etc.)

•  Customer purchasing trends over the past 5 years

•  Customer feedback and satisfaction surveys

•  Pricing details and billing history

## 2. Investigation Techniques:
We will use the following techniques to investigate the issue:

•  Descriptive Analytics: To summarize the historical data and understand the current state of customer retention and churn.

•  Predictive Analytics: To identify patterns and predict future customer behavior using machine learning models.

## Datascience framework

Step 1: Define the Problem

•  Problem Statement: Identify the key factors influencing customer decisions to stay with or switch from PowerCo.

## Step 2: Collect Data
•  Gather the data mentioned above from the client.

## Step 3: Process Data
•  Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for analysis.

## Step 4: Analyze Data
•  Use descriptive and predictive analytics, sentiment analysis, and comparative analysis to investigate the key reasons for customer retention or switching.

## Step 5: Interpret Results
•  Interpret the analysis results to provide actionable insights and recommendations for improving customer retention.

# Business Insights and Recommendations
Customer Retention Strategies
1. Targeted Interventions:
•  Insight: The high number of false negatives indicates that many churners are not being identified. Implement targeted retention strategies for at-risk customers by focusing on those with similar profiles to the false negatives.
•  Action: Develop personalized offers, loyalty programs, and proactive customer service interventions to retain these customers.
2. Enhanced Customer Segmentation:
•  Insight: The current features may not be sufficiently discriminative. By refining customer segmentation, we can better understand the different factors driving churn.
•  Action: Use advanced segmentation techniques to identify distinct customer groups and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

Product and Service Improvements
1. Feature Enhancement:
•  Insight: The model's performance suggests that additional or alternative features could improve churn prediction. Investigate other potential churn drivers beyond price sensitivity.
•  Action: Conduct surveys and gather customer feedback to identify new features that could be incorporated into the model.
2. Service Quality Monitoring:
•  Insight: Poor service quality could be a hidden driver of churn. Regularly monitor and improve service quality to enhance customer satisfaction.
•  Action: Implement a robust feedback mechanism to continuously gather and act on customer feedback.
Pricing Strategies
1. Dynamic Pricing Models:
•  Insight: While price sensitivity is a weak contributor, it still plays a role in churn. Implementing dynamic pricing models could help retain price-sensitive customers.
•  Action: Use data analytics to adjust pricing strategies based on customer behavior and market trends.

2. Value-Based Pricing:
•  Insight: Customers may perceive higher value in services that are priced according to their needs and usage patterns.
•  Action: Develop value-based pricing strategies that align with customer expectations and perceived value.

Data-Driven Decision Making
1. Continuous Model Improvement:
•  Insight: The model needs continuous refinement to improve its predictive power.
•  Action: Establish a regular review and update cycle for the model, incorporating new data and feedback to enhance its accuracy.

2. Cross-Functional Collaboration:
•  Insight: Collaboration between CRM, analytics, and other departments is crucial for holistic improvements.
•  Action: Foster cross-functional teams to ensure that insights from the model are effectively translated into actionable business strategies.

By implementing these insights and recommendations, we can enhance our ability to predict and prevent customer churn, ultimately leading to improved customer retention and business growth.
